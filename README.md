<h1> A personal memory valut :</h1>
<p>This is an application that was created thinking the need of keeping and storing all the important liks at 
 a single place !!!So rather than just doing a watsapp to youself you may save them all in a organised way at a single place</p>
 <br>This project is made on TS so that it may be easy for the devloper to built further on it .

 <h4>SET UP:</h4>
 <p>For doing the set up :
 
   <ul>
     <li>Fork the repo</li>1) 
     <li>Read the scripts file</li>
     <li>Go to the backend folder and then run npm run dev to start the backend locally on the system</li>
     <li>Go to the frontend folder and then type npm run dev for making the vite run on the localhost:5173 ......</li>
     </ul>
     In this way you may be able to use the Application for storing all the important links you want.
</p>
